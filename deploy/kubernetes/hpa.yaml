# HorizontalPodAutoscaler for the Sortie server Deployment.
#
# Scaling Rules:
#   1. CPU utilization: scale up when average CPU exceeds 70% of requests.
#      The server is primarily I/O-bound (WebSocket proxying, HTTP routing)
#      so CPU spikes indicate genuine load, not transient computation.
#
#   2. Memory utilization: scale up when average memory exceeds 80% of requests.
#      Each active WebSocket connection holds state in memory; sustained memory
#      pressure signals too many concurrent connections per replica.
#
# Scale-up behavior:
#   - Pods are added quickly (up to 4 at a time, or 100% increase, every 60s)
#     because new session requests are latency-sensitive.
#
# Scale-down behavior:
#   - Pods are removed gradually (1 at a time, every 5 minutes) to avoid
#     disrupting in-flight WebSocket connections and to prevent thrashing
#     during bursty workloads.
#
# Custom metrics (optional):
#   If a Prometheus adapter or KEDA is available, the commented-out section
#   below can scale on the sortie_active_sessions metric exposed at /metrics.
#   This provides session-aware scaling independent of CPU/memory.
#
# Prerequisites:
#   - metrics-server must be installed for CPU/memory metrics.
#   - For custom metrics: prometheus-adapter or KEDA + Prometheus.
